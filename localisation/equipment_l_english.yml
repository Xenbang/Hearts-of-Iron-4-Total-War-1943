Armour was 11mm and main armament was the 20mm KwK35 L/45 ( later some used captured T-26 turrets) and the vehicle tipped the scale at over 12 tons. Powertrain consisted of a massive 12 litre straight six producing 150 HP and allowed a road top speed of 70 km/h."

Armour was 14 mm at the front on a sloped body, suitable to deflect most small or low-velocity projectiles. The standard armament was a MG 34 machine-gun in an open Turret. Official designation was Leichter Panzerspähwagen Sdkfz.221 (Light Reconnaissance Armored Car -Special Purpose Vehicle 221). 340 were delivered from 1936 to 1939. This four-wheeled vehicle proved to be fast ( 80 km/h ) and agile, but it quickly became apparent it had limited off-road capabilities. In some cases, the original MG was swapped for an anti-tank rifle 39 or, later, a model 41 28 mm anti-tank gun, in order to increase its firepower.

The series 1 to 5 received a sPkw I Horch 801 chassis with the 3.5 liter engine, and the series 6-7, the sPkw V chassis and 3.8 l engine. The overall weight rose accordingly to 4.8 tons. It managed a road top speed of 80 km/h. and had the same limitations crosscountry as the 221.

The original 6 Rad (6 wheel) versions were based on a 6x4 truck with an armoured body, but its offroad mobility was insufficient and by 1937 they were being replaced by the 8 Rad versions. The Sdkfz.231 had 15 mm of slightly sloped front armour. Production versions of the SdKfz.231 were fitted with a 155 HP, eight-cylinder Büssing-NAG L8V-G petrol engine, which gave a top speed of 85 km/h. From July 1942 they were built on the same Einheitsfahrgestell chassis and had their armour increased to 30 mm. Later a more powerful engine was installed, providing 180 PS instead of 155 PS. It had all-wheel-drive, all-wheel-steering and two driver positions at front and rear. The turret in the 231/232 series was a hexagonal shape and equipped with a 2 cm KwK 30 L/55 autocannon and a coaxial 7.92 mm MG 34 machine gun."

Among other priorities, better protection with 30mm front armour and heavier armament in different versions ( ranging from 20mm to KwK39 50mm and short and long barreled 75mm KwK´s) were viewed as crucial for the new armored car. It had a Tatra 103 V12 diesel engine with 210 hp allowing a top road speed of 90 km/h."

light_uk_tank_equipment_1_short:0 "Light Tank Mk IV"
light_uk_tank_equipment_1_desc:0 "The first dedicated Light Tanks built by Vickers were turreted developments of the widely exported Carden-Loyd Tankette. Equipped with a Vickers 7.7 mm machine gun, and Horstmann suspension, the Mk IV was the definitive early version of the design. Mk IVs served throughout the Commonwealth but quickly became outdated."
light_uk_tank_equipment_2:0 "Vickers Light Tank Mk V (A5)"
light_uk_tank_equipment_2_short:0 "Light Tank Mk V"
light_uk_tank_equipment_2_desc:0 "The first Commonwealth three-man Light Tank in service. The extra crew member, and an updated armament of 7.7 mm and 15 mm Besa machine guns in a twin mount, made the Mk V a far more effective combat vehicle. The increase in weight affected mobility on rough ground somewhat, but overall range was largely unchanged."
light_uk_tank_equipment_3:0 "Vickers Light Tank Mk VI (A6)"
light_uk_tank_equipment_3_short:0 "Light Tank Mk VI"
light_uk_tank_equipment_3_desc:0 "Built in several versions, and in large quantities. The Mk VIa retained the armament of the Mk V, while the Mk VIb had a compact 15 mm Besa and an upgraded 7.92 mm coaxial. The Mk VIc kept the 7.92 mm coaxial, while the main gun was a long barrel 15 mm Besa, which had excellent muzzle velocity but limited punch."

light_uk_tank_equipment_4_short:0 "Tetrarch"
light_uk_tank_equipment_4_desc:0 "Vickers-Armstrong chief tank designer - Leslie Little - designed the Tetrarch as a major upgrade to the Mk VI. It had a 2 pdr 40 mm gun with a 7.92 mm Besa coaxial, and a new coil suspension system. The light weight of the vehicle coupled with the Meadows 165 hp engine, made the Tetratch fast and easy to transport."

light_uk_tank_equipment_5_desc:0 "The last of the Vickers-Armstrong Light Tanks produced. Developed from the Tetrarch, the length, width, and armour protection of the Mk VIII was increased, and a new power-assisted steering system was installed. Mk VIIIs served in mainly auxillary roles as Commonwealth armoured divisions gradually withdrew Light Tanks."

The 2 pdr 37 mm main gun was respectable, though the frontal 7.7 mm Vickers machine gun turrets made the six man tank difficult to command."
medium_uk_tank_equipment_1:0 "Cruiser Tank Mk II (A10)"
medium_uk_tank_equipment_1_short:0 "Cruiser Mk II"
medium_uk_tank_equipment_1_desc:0 "A heavier development of the original Mk I, intended as an infantry tank but deemed unsuitable. The removal of the frontal 7.7 mm machine gun turrets, and extra armour bolted to the hull increased relative protection, but the tank remained underpowered. Despite its flaws it served in serveral theaters."

medium_uk_tank_equipment_2_desc:0 "The Covenanter was the first cruiser tank to be given a name. Large numbers of the tank were produced but early versions suffered in hot climates. The low profile, four man tank was the culmination of the A13 program, innovations giving mobility to the cruiser squadrons, at the expense armour protection."

medium_uk_tank_equipment_3_short:0 "Crusader"
medium_uk_tank_equipment_3_desc:0 "Considered by many to be the first proper cruiser tank.

Despite experiences of the Second Sino-Japanese War, armored personnel carriers were viewed as too slow compared to wheeled trucks and there was not much effort for their development in the army. It could carry 13 passengers and had a max of 8mm armor."

They were the direct copy of the successful Holland type submarines. They were designed to be good sea boats well-armed for their time."
 CCP_submarine_2:0 "Series V Shchuka"
 CCP_submarine_2_desc:0 "The Series V submarines of the Schuka class were the second-most numerous submarines of the Soviet Navy. Their large number came from their deployment to the four fleets of the Soviet Union: Black Sea, Baltic, Northern and Pacific. They were medium-sized patrol submarines with good torpedo armament and seaworthiness."
 CCP_submarine_3:0 "Series XIV K-Class"
 CCP_submarine_3_desc:0 "The Series XIV submarines were large cruising submarines with extended range. They were essentially an improved version of the Series IV Pravda class. These submarines featured heavy armament of both surface guns and torpedoes. They had a long range but only satisfactory seaworthiness."
 CCP_submarine_4:0 "Han Class"
 CCP_submarine_4_desc:0 "The Project 611 submarines (NATO Codename: Zulu), were the Soviet Navy's first submarine class to be built after WWII. Their design was based on the German Type XXI submarines, and they were meant to replace the older Series XIV K class boats. They were large, ocean-going submarines with a heavy torpedo armament and long range. They were used as a basis for the follow-up Project 613 (NATO Codename: Whiskey) and Project 641 (NATO Codename: Foxtrot) class submarines."
 CCP_destroyer_1:0 "Type 30 Class"
 CCP_destroyer_1_desc:0 "The Orfey class destroyers were an improved version of the previous Novik class.

 CCP_destroyer_2:0 "Type 39 Class"
 CCP_destroyer_2_desc:0 "The Gnevny class (Project 7) destroyers were authorized under the 1933-1938 shipbuilding program. The class itself was heavily influenced by the Italian destroyer Maestrale and considered a successful design. Their displacement were in the range of 1,600-2,000 tons, they were well-armed and they had adequate AA and torpedo armament. Due to the powerful engines they were fast but short-ranged vessels."
 CCP_destroyer_3:0 "Type 42 Class"
 CCP_destroyer_3_desc:0 "The Soobrazitelnyi (Project 7U) destroyers were an improved version of the previous Gnevny class. Their engines were redesigned and they had a stronger AA armament. They displaced between 1,900 and 2,400 tons, and their speed and range were similar to the Gnevny class."
 CCP_destroyer_4:0 "Type 52 Class"
 CCP_destroyer_4_desc:0 "The Skoryi class (Project 30bis) was a further improvement on the Ognevoy class. The increase in size and displacement (2,500-3,100 tons) resulted in a more stable ship with an increased operational range. All ships were built after the War to a modular design that resulted in rapid construction and deployment times. Their armament was the same as that of the previous Ognevoy class, but the main guns were housed in twin turrets instead of single turrets."

These vessels were the first turbine-driven cruisers of the Imperial Russian Navy. They were heavily armed and well-armored cruisers for their time."
 CCP_light_cruiser_2:0 "Type 35C Class"
 CCP_light_cruiser_2_desc:0 "The Komsomolets class light cruisers were series of hypothetical vessels. They were somewhat of a mix of older and new technologies. Using the incomplete hulls of the Svetlana and Admiral Nakhimov classes, the ship's construction costs were reduced. Equipped with six twin turrets of smaller, destroyer caliber guns and adequate AA armament they were suited for scouting and a destroyer flotilla leader role. The overall look of the ships bears similarities to the Kirov class cruisers."
 CCP_light_cruiser_3:0 "Type 44C Class"
 CCP_light_cruiser_3_desc:0 "The Chapayev class (Project 68) cruisers were based on the Kirov class (Project 26) cruisers and authorized in the 1938-43 shipbuilding program. As the first true light cruisers of the Soviet navy, they carried a strong anti-surface and anti-air armament together with an adequate torpedo armament. Overall, these were good ships with a thick armor belt, high speed, a good operational range, and a displacement of 10,500 to 14,000 tons. Due to the war and the invasion of the German forces, many ships of the class were cancelled and the rest were finished after the hostilities ended."
 CCP_light_cruiser_4:0 "Type 50C Class"
 CCP_light_cruiser_4_desc:0 "The Sverdlov class cruisers (Project 68bis) were the last gun cruisers of the Soviet Navy and were improved versions of the preceding Chapayev class. Compared to the Chapayevs, they had the same main armament, machinery and armor protection, but had increased fuel capacity for greater range, improved underwater protection, an increased anti-aircraft battery, and slightly better seaworthiness. They were designed for the roles of convoy hunting and capital ship escorts. Due to the advent of the missile age, many ships were cancelled or not finished."
 CCP_heavy_cruiser_1:0 "Type 30HC Class"
 CCP_heavy_cruiser_1_desc:0 "The Krasnyi Kavkaz cruiser, originally the Admiral Nakhimov class light cruiser, was the half-sister of the Chervona Ukraina. Krasnyi Kavkaz was completed with a modified design that included larger-caliber 180mm guns and stronger AA armament. Because she was a rebuilt light cruiser, her armor was thinner compared to the heavy cruisers of other navies."
 CCP_heavy_cruiser_2:0 "Type 38HC Class"
 CCP_heavy_cruiser_2_desc:0 "The Kirov class (Project 26) cruisers were the Soviet Navy's first modern cruisers. The design was based on the Italian Raimondo Montecuccoli class light cruisers and was built as part of the 1933-1938 shipbuilding program. The ships displaced between 7,700 and 9,200 tons. They were armed with new 180mm guns in 3 triple turrets and a solid AA battery. Their strong engines provided good speed and an acceptable operational range, while the armor belt was thin compared to other heavy cruisers."
 CCP_heavy_cruiser_3:0 "Type 43HC Class"
 CCP_heavy_cruiser_3_desc:0 "The Project 22 heavy cruisers were designed in the mid 1930's to counter similar vessels in neighboring countries. The design called for a larger-sized vessel displacing between 15,500 and 17,000 tons. They were equipped with four triple 240mm cannons to fight off enemy cruisers, a heavy AA armament for self-defense, and a larger scout plane force to find the enemy. Their main tasks would be to scout for enemy forces and convoy hunting. The cost of the ships and the allocation of resources to other needs resulted in the cancellation of the project."
 CCP_heavy_cruiser_4:0 "Type 58HC Class"
 CCP_heavy_cruiser_4_desc:0 "The Project 66 heavy cruisers were the Soviet Navy's last attempt to design and build a purely gun cruiser. Design studies started in 1943 and the final version emerged after the war. The vessels would feature 220mm cannons in 3 triple turrets and a strong AA armament. Displacement would be at least 26,500 tons. The advent of the missile age and the death of Josef Stalin caused the project to be terminated."
 CCP_battle_cruiser_1:0 "Type 40BC Class"
 CCP_battle_cruiser_1_desc:0 "The Borodino-class battlecruisers were class of four vessels authorized in 1914, just before WWI. They were based on the Imperatritsa Mariya class battleships. They followed the contemporary Russian capital ship building practices of using four triple turrets to house the heavy main armament, strong secondary armament in casemates, and an overall flush-deck. They had a low profile with low draught to fight in the shallow waters of the Baltic Sea. Like many Russian ships of this period, the outbreak of WWI and the Russian Revolution doomed these ships from ever being finished."
 CCP_battle_cruiser_2:0 "Type 51BC Class"
 CCP_battle_cruiser_2_desc:0 "The Kronshtadt class (Project 69) battlecruisers were authorized in the 1938-43 shipbuilding program and scheduled to be finished in the 1940's. The original design aimed for a large-sized heavy cruiser of 23,000 tons, but after information on German Scharnhorst battlecruisers arrived, the ships were redesigned to displace to 35,000 tons. As hostilities broke out between Germany and the Soviet Union, the ships construction was halted and eventually cancelled. Alternative plans called for finishing the incomplete hulls as aircraft carriers under Project 69AV."
 CCP_battleship_1:0 "Zhou  Class"
 CCP_battleship_1_desc:0 "The Marat class battleships (originally Gangut class) were WWI-era battleships and the first Dreadnoughts to serve in the Imperial Russian Navy. Their design and turret layout served as the basis of all the succeeding battleship and battlecruiser classes. Only three ships survived the chaos of the Russian Revolution. They were modernized and refitted during the 1930's, resulting in a tall almost pagoda-like superstructure. They had modern electronics and a strong AA complement."
 CCP_battleship_2:0 "Chen Class"
 CCP_battleship_2_desc:0 "The Project 21 battleships were designed in the mid 1930's to be part of Stalin's Ocean-Going Navy. They would be very similar to the British Nelson-class battleships. The ships would displace around 41,000 tons, would be armed with nine 406mm cannons in 3 triple turrets (all forward), and a secondary armament of twelve 152mm guns. Its good AA armament and thick armor provided a strong defense against air and surface targets. The project was eventually cancelled but part of its elements were used in the Sovetsky Soyuz-class (Project 23) battleships."
 CCP_battleship_3:0 "Zhu De Class"
 CCP_battleship_3_desc:0 "The Lenin-class battleship was a hypothetical design to match and counter the German Bismarck and U.S. South Dakota class battleships. Its nine 406mm cannons in 3 triple turrets would provide adequate firepower, while its 130mm AA guns, thick armor, and large engines would ensure its survival in battle."
 CCP_battleship_4:0 "Mao Class"
 CCP_battleship_4_desc:0 "The Stalingrad class (Project 82) capital ships were intended to provide the Soviet navy with its primary firepower in the post WWII era. They were fast, well-armed, and well-armored vessels. Construction started after the war, but the death of Josif Stalin led to the cancellation of these ships, though there were projects to finish at least one as a modified design equipped with Soviet V-2 missiles."
 CCP_SH_battleship_1:0 "Type 50SHBB Project"
 CCP_SH_battleship_1_desc:0 "The Sovetsky Soyuz-class (Project 23) was the last class of battleships built by the Soviet shipyards and were authorized in the 1938-43 shipbuilding program. Four ships were planned with a standard displacement of 59,000 tons, three triple turrets carrying 406mm cannons, and a heavy secondary and AA armament. They also had strong engines to accommodate their very thick belt armor. The outbreak of the war prevented these ships from being completed."
 CCP_SH_battleship_2:0 "Type 59SHBB Project"
 CCP_SH_battleship_2_desc:0 "The Project 23bis-class battleships were a modified and improved version of the previous Sovetsky Soyuz-class (Project 23). Compared to their predecessors, they carried four triple turrets of the same 406mm caliber cannons, thickened belt armor, a revised layout of secondary guns, and stronger AA armament."
 CCP_carrier_1:0 "Yulin Class"
 CCP_carrier_1_desc:0 "The Ismail class aircraft carrier was the direct conversion of the unfinished hull of her Borodino-class battlecruiser namesake. Due to the nature of conversion, the ship would have a thick armor belt and strong anti-surface and AA armament for her time. A moderately-sized air group would provide her fleet the necessary air cover. The project was not carried out due to costs and the state of the Soviet shipbuilding industry after the October Revolution."
 CCP_carrier_2:0 "Shanghai Class"
 CCP_carrier_2_desc:0 "The Krasnyi Vozdukh-class aircraft carrier was a hypothetical design to provide the Soviet navy air projection over its fleets. They were similar in size to the British Ark Royal or Japanese Hiryu classes but carried additional secondary guns against surface targets and adequate AA guns for air cover. The increased armor results in a slightly reduced air group compared to these classes."
 CCP_carrier_3:0 "Beijing Class"
 CCP_carrier_3_desc:0 "The Project 71B carriers were designed in the mid-to-late 1930's. They were planned to provide air cover for the new surface fleets Stalin ordered in his plan. Two ships were planned that would displace around 30,000 tons, have strong AA armament, good armor, and an adequate air group. The German invasion caused the cancellation of construction for these vessels."
 CCP_carrier_4:0 "Liaoning Class"
 CCP_carrier_4_desc:0 "The Project 72 aircraft carriers were the improved versions of the previous Project 71 ships. Design studies finished in the early 1940's resulting in a larger ship with thinner armor. The extra space was used to install stronger AA armament and provide for the ability to carry a larger air group."

 JAP_infantry_weapons_desc:0 "The Type 38 Rifle Arisaka was a bolt-action rifle developed as an advancement on the Type 30 after the Russo-Japanese War. It used a low-recoil 6.5x50mm cartridge which lacked penetrating power. It was a very long rifle, at 1.28 meters, due to the Japanese emphasis on bayonet fighting. The rifle gained an additional 0.4m when the bayonet was fixed. About 3,400,000 were produced from 1906 to 1942."

The Type 99 was designed similarly to the Type 38, but fired a 7.7mm cartridge instead of a 6.5x50mm. It was a solid bolt-action rifle, but was outclassed at close range by automatic weapons. While it was intended to completely replace the Type 38, this never materialized due to resource and production constraints. About 3,500,000 were built from 1939 to 1945."

It was developed after experiences from the war in China and was made in preparation for the Blitzkreig in the East. It fired the same cartridges as the type 99, but it's performance and reliability was considerably improved.

 JAP_infantry_equipment_3_desc:0 "The Type 100/44 Submachine Gun was an improved version of the Type 100 which featured a considerably higher firing rate of 800 rpm, and much better reliability due to less complicated design. The barrel was slightly longer, and the bayonet mounting bar / bipod were eliminated. Due to the late stage of the war, corners were cut frequently in production, but the weapon still had great field performance. About 8,000 were built from 1944 to 1945."

 JAP_infantry_equipment_4_short:0 "Type 4"
 JAP_infantry_equipment_4_desc:0 "The Type 4 Rifle was a Japanese response to semi-automatic rifle development in other countries. Rather than designing one from scratch, they elected to copy the M1 Garand, which they were coming into frequent contact with on the Pacfic Theater. The Type 4 was a reversed engineered copy of the M1 Garand, which had an internal magazine as opposed to an en-bloc clip. The rifle was supposed to begin mass production in 1945, but only 100 of a 250-gun order were completed before the war ended."

Due to its low height and extremely angled front plate ( 60mm at 60°angle) it was difficult to destroy, however the sides and rear were extremely thinly armored and only protected vs. small arms.

With the Ausf M chassis, the engine was located near the middle of the vehicle, and the armament was placed at the rear in a specially designed armoured section. The superstructure could fold down to allow 360-degree traverse at low elevation. Including the single prototype, 141 Flakpanzer 38(t)s were built from November 1943 to February 1944, entering service in 1944."

A total of 434 were built; of these, the Germans seized 244 when they occupied Bohemia-Moravia in March 1939 and the Slovaks acquired 52 when they declared independence from Czechoslovakia at the same time. Others were exported to Bulgaria and Romania. In German service, it saw combat during the early years of World War II, notably the Invasion of Poland, the Battle of France and the invasion of the Soviet Union before being retired or sold off in 1942."

After Czechoslovakia was taken over by Germany, it was adopted by the German Army. Production ended in 1942, when its main armament was deemed inadequate. In all, over 1,400 Pz. 38(t)s were manufactured. The chassis of the Pz. 38(t) continued to be produced for the Marder III (1942–1944) with some of its components used in the later Jagdpanzer 38 (1944–1945) tank destroyers and its derivative vehicles. It was considered an excellent tank, especially compared to the Panzer I and Panzer II that were the Panzerwaffe's main tanks during the outset of WWII. The Panzer 38(t) performed well in the Polish Campaign in 1939 and the Battle of France in 1940. It was better armed than the Panzer I and Panzer II tanks. It was on a par with most Light Tank designs of the era, although it was unable to effectively engage the frontal armour of medium, heavy and infantry tank designs."

 panzer_vi_ag_equipment_2_desc:0 "Heavy Assault gun based on the Tiger II chassis. The original Rammtiger of F.Porsche was redesigned due to unreliability and unavailability of the Tiger Prototype (P) chassis. Because of the shape of the Hull it was sometimes called Turtle or Battleship. It had an elongated wedgeshaped front with steeply angled 200mm of armour and a angled keel-like turretless upper hull. On the upper front was a armored shutter which housed a ´leichter Ladungswerfer 200mm´. It was a spigot mortar with 700m range ( a slim spigot where the projectile was slid over and electrically ignited ) which was withdrawn from regular service. The mortar had a loading chamber which closes off to the interior after the mortar is loaded. Since the mortar shells only weighed 23kg, loading was much easier and faster than with the RW61. It carried a loadout of 76 shells. In addition small 100mm doughnut shaped mortar rounds for point defense for the spigot were carried which would burst 2 meters over the hull and spray the surrounding with shrapnell. Specially trained Combat pioneers accompanied the Rammtiger and stayed in radio contact to coordinate with the close defense mortar use."

The Tiger II combined the thick armor of the Tiger I with the sloped armor used on the Panther Medium Tank. The tank weighed over 68 tons, was protected by 100 to 180mm of armor to the front and was armed with the long barreled 8.8 cm Kampfwagenkanone 43 L/71 gun. It was powered by a V-12 Maybach HL 230 P30 700 PS engine which allowed a top road speed of around 40 km/h, it however was underpowered and the mobility suffered."

Secondary it had an armoured blister housing a twin 30mm MK108 on the right Turret roof. It was able to shoot at ground targets as well as air targets at an elevation of 70°. No less than four 92mm Nahverteidigungswaffen ( close defense weapon ) were in the corner roofs of the turret compartment, able to shower each surrounding surface with shrapnell. Due to the steeper sloping the turret armour was thinner than with the Maus at around 200mm at the front and 170mm at the sides which made it better protected vs. ranged attacks and a slightly more difficult target for aerial bombardment but more vulnerable to limpet mines."

It was a high speed design dedicated to drag reduction with a new cooling concept, the surface evaporative cooling where the water/glycol coolant was allowed to develop steam and to expand into cooling chambers. This system is almost drag free but would have been very vulnerable to damage. However with the production version He-100 D-1 the cooling was redesigned to a conventional system and additional air cooled radiators were installed. The new D-1 was therefore slower but still managed a speed of 644 km/h. Due to the drag-reduced airframe ranges of 900-1000 km were possible.

The Fw 190 A-1 provided greater firepower with its 4 x 7,92mm MG17 and 2 x 20mm MG FF/M than the Bf 109, and, at low to medium altitude, superior maneuverability, in the opinion of German pilots who flew both fighters. The Fw 190A series' was not a high-altitude interceptor its performance suffered higher than 6000m.

One particularly acute problem arose with the lack of an alloy with a melting point high enough to endure the high temperatures involved, the service life of an engine was therefore 20-50 hours. The aircraft made its first successful flight entirely on jet power on 18 July 1942, powered by a pair of Jumo 004 engines. With its top speed of 900 km/h and heavy armament of 4 x 30mm MK108 cannons it was best suited as a bomber destroyer, since its agility was not suited for dogfights. 24 x 55mm R4M Rockets could be carried and the Sturmvogel could carry up to 2 x 500kg bombs."

Armour protection was increased and the rear gunner position switched to a new dual-barrel 7.92mm  MG 81Z machine gun. Engine power was increased again, the Jumo 211J now delivering 1,420 HP allowing a top speed of 450 km/h.  Bomb carrying ability was nearly quadrupled from 500 kg  in the B-version to 1,800 kg  in the D-version (max. load for short ranges, overload condition), a typical bomb load ranged from 500–1,200 kg. The D4 exchanged the two 7.92 mm MG 17 wing guns with 20 mm MG 151/20s to better suit the aircraft's ground-attack role."

The power-plant was still a Junkers Jumo 211J, and two 30 mm cannons were added. It was also designed to carry a 1,000 kg free-fall bomb load. Furthermore, the armoured protection of the Ilyushin Il-2 Sturmovik was copied to protect the crew from ground fire now that the Ju 87 would be required to conduct low level attacks. The maximum speed slightly rose to 480 km/h probably by removing dive bombing equipment. It was had suggested using two 37 mm Flak18 guns, each one in a self-contained under-wing gun pod using tungsten carbide rounds.

Although the low-wing monoplane offered by Nakajima was more advanced, the Army preferred the more maneuverable biplane offered by Kawasaki. In order to overcome the speed disadvantage the Kawasaki team used a metal three-blade propeller in the third prototype, while flush-head rivets were used in an attempt to reduce drag. The structure was of all-metal construction, which was then fabric-covered. Armament consisted of two 7.7 mm (.303 in) Type 89 machine guns, synchronized to fire through the propeller. The initial production version was powered by a liquid-cooled 633 kW (850 hp) Kawasaki Ha9-IIa V-12. About 300 of the initial production version were made from December 1935 to October 1937, and another 280 of a second variant, the Ki-10-II, were built from June 1937 to December 1938."

The speed requirement submitted by the naval department was again also unprecedented, not only in Japanese but also in international heavy bomber aviation, where in relation to the envisaged Japanese battlegrounds of China and the Pacific, the bomber would need to not only cover long distances, but necessarily have exceptional speed to strike distant targets with a minimum attack time. Thus the G3M was an embodiment of Japanese military aircraft design in the brief period leading to the Pacific War, with powerful offensive armament; range and speed were emphasised over protection & defense. 1,048 were built from 1935 to 1945."

Each turret had an observation slit and a round firing port for the DT machine-gun. These turrets existed in four different models and configurations, although still mounted in the same locations, with the same height and generally same features. All had a 240° arc of fire and armor ranging from 13 to 15 mm (0.51-0.59 in), although the very first 1931 models had only 10 mm (0.39 in) of mediocre alloy, susceptible to machine-gun fire. The model 1931 (100 units), 1932 (1361) and 1933 (before upgrading - 576) were all twin-turreted versions. About 2038 were built in all. "

The main armament will remain unchanged until the end of the production in 1941, but the model 1938 received a brand new cast turret with sloped angles, the same armor and a PTK commander’s panoramic sight for newly radio-equipped commander tanks. This turret was also factory-equipped with a rear gun port, first introduced in 1935, for a third DT machine-gun. After the battle of Lake Khasan in August 1938, the turret base was reinforced with a sloped underturret plate, 20 mm (0.79 in) strong. This late model was called the model 1939 or T-26-1 in some sources. \n In all, 4,826 model 1938 and 1939 tanks were built. "

This was done because the need for a direct fire support weapon was high, as troops needed more direct medium or heavy fire support weapons, and it was a useful way of utilizing obsolete types of T-26 tanks. This new Assault Gun was armed with a 76.2 mm  KT-28 gun. Shortly after production began however, it was decided that some of the chassis would remain as T-26 tanks as stocks of the tanks began to run short. Therefore, only 14 SU-26s were manufactured."

Whilst such a large number were produced, it was hated by all who had to deal with it – all except the Germans, who found it to be a substandard and underwhelming opponent, and a rather nice ammunition carrier or gun towing tractor, once captured. \n In 1942, the T-60’s frontal armor was increased to 35 mm (1.37 in), which was still inadequate and made the tank more sluggish. \n Finally, any attempt to increase the caliber of the gun proved difficult. There were attempts to replace the main gun with a 37 mm (1.45 in) ZiS-19 or a 45 mm (1.77 in) ZiS-19BM, but proved unsuccessful as a result of the small turret.

Whilst the gun was generally better suited to the reality of tank-on-tank warfare, it still had poor mobility and underwhelming protection. The tank’s legacy passed on into the somewhat well-known SU-76 self-propelled gun, which was also a less than desirable tank. \n The T-70 was armed with a 45-mm L/46 gun Model 38 with forty-five rounds carried, and a coaxial 7.62-mm DT machine gun."

Both tanks offered similar performance, so introducing the T-44 was not considered as important as increasing T-34 production. Fewer than 2,000 T-44s were built, compared to about 84,000 T-34s.

It used the chassis of the T-44 Med.TK and was intended to replace the SU-100 which itself had only entered service with the Red Army in late 1944. Two prototypes of the Uralmash-1 with different armament were built in early 1945, one with the 100 mm D-10 tank gun, the other with the 122 mm D-25S tank gun. While mass production was initially recommended, the end of the war with Germany in May 1945 eventually caused the project to be cancelled due to lack of necessity. If the Uralmash-1 had entered service, the 100 mm variant would have been designated SU-101 (СУ-101) while the 122 mm variant would have been designated SU-102 (СУ-102)."

NZL_motorized_lia_equipment_01_desc:0 "A military liaison vehicle used to coordinate between units in the field and light transport. This is a military adaption of a later model of one of the most successful series of British cars, the Austin 7. The modifications are relatively sparse, with anything not strictly necessary stripped out, more storage, military wheels, tow rings and an altered fuel tank. Historically the Austin 7 was produced between 1922 and 1939. The British Army purchased a number of batches of Austin 7's for liaison use prewar. Austin and Morris assembly in New Zealand started in 1934. Civilian cars of all kinds were requisitioned at the onset of war, and NZ infantry battalions had an official establishment of 6 Austin two-seaters as of 1941."
